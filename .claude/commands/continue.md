Continue working on the Date An Intervention project from where we left off.

Instructions:
1. Check recent git commits to see what was last worked on
2. Review TASKS.md to see current task status
3. Check for any uncommitted changes in the working directory
4. Provide a brief summary of:
   - Last completed work
   - Current task in progress (if any)
   - Next logical step
5. Ask if I want to:
   - Continue the current task
   - Start a new task
   - Review what's been done so far

Be ready to jump back into development with full context.
