# Dating App Style Guide

Guidelines for maintaining the playful dating app aesthetic while educating about climate interventions.

## Core Principles

1. **Playful but Informative**: Make learning fun without trivializing the science
2. **Approachable**: Complex climate topics presented in relatable terms
3. **Honest**: Don't oversell or hide limitations
4. **Engaging**: Use dating app conventions creatively
5. **Respectful**: Balance humor with the serious nature of climate change

## Voice & Tone

### Overall App Voice

**Characteristics**:
- Warm and inviting
- Playfully romantic
- Optimistic but realistic
- Conversational, not academic
- Curious and open-minded

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Looking for a climate solution that's your perfect match?"
- ✅ "Swipe right on the interventions that catch your eye"
- ❌ "Evaluate climate geoengineering strategies"
- ❌ "Assess mitigation potential"

### Intervention Personas

Each intervention should have a distinct personality based on its characteristics:

**Bold/Controversial interventions** (SAI, Iron Fertilization):
- Confident, direct
- Acknowledges controversy head-on
- "I know I'm polarizing, but I get results"

**Natural/Proven solutions** (Reforestation, Biochar):
- Warm, nurturing
- Patient and steady
- "Good things take time"

**High-tech/Futuristic** (DAC, Space Reflectors):
- Innovative, optimistic
- Acknowledges challenges
- "I'm expensive now, but my potential is huge"

**Localized/Community** (Urban Forestry, Mangroves):
- Down-to-earth, practical
- Community-focused
- "I might not save the world, but I make my corner better"

## Writing Guidelines

### Profile Bios

**Structure**:
1. Opening hook (personality/approach)
2. What they do (in relatable terms)
3. Their vibe/values
4. What they're looking for (meta: what kind of support they need)

**Example - Stratospheric Aerosol Injection**:
> "High-altitude dreamer looking to cool things down. I work in the stratosphere, literally above it all. Love sunsets (I make them better!) and thinking big picture. Some say I'm controversial, but I get results fast. Looking for someone who appreciates bold solutions and isn't afraid of a little uncertainty."

**Tips**:
- First person perspective
- 2-4 sentences
- Include a playful detail or two
- Be honest about personality (controversial, expensive, etc.)
- End with what they're "looking for"

### Interests (Pros)

Present advantages as dating profile "interests":

**Format**: Brief, punchy statements

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Fast acting - can see results in months"
- ✅ "Relatively low cost compared to other global solutions"
- ✅ "Reversible if we change our minds"
- ❌ "Demonstrates high efficacy in climate modeling scenarios"
- ❌ "Cost-effective per ton CO2 equivalent"

**Tone**: Positive but honest, conversational

### Dealbreakers (Cons)

Present disadvantages as dating profile "dealbreakers":

**Format**: Direct, honest statements about limitations

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Doesn't address ocean acidification"
- ✅ "Requires international cooperation and governance"
- ✅ "Unknown ecosystem impacts"
- ❌ "Potential negative externalities on marine ecosystems"
- ❌ "Governance frameworks currently insufficient"

**Tone**: Frank but not alarmist, conversational

### Age Labels

Use "age" as a metaphor for other attributes:

**Conventions**:
- Years of research: "28" for established, "24" for newer
- Timescale: "Ancient" for geological, "Timeless" for permanent
- Maturity: Higher numbers for well-established interventions

**Examples**:
- "Strat, 28" - Active research for ~30 years
- "Peat, Ancient" - Peatlands are ancient ecosystems
- "DAC, Futuristic" - Cutting-edge technology
- "Alpine, Ancient" - Glaciers are ancient

### Distance Labels

Use "distance" as a metaphor for impact scale:

**Conventions**:
- "Localized Impact" = affects small areas
- "Regional Impact" = affects larger regions
- "Global Impact" = affects entire planet

**Display**: Show with globe emoji
- 📍 Localized Impact
- 🗺️ Regional Impact
- 🌍 Global Impact

## Conversation Style

### Chat Personality Guidelines

Each intervention's chat responses should match their profile personality:

**Bold interventions** (SAI):
```
User: Tell me more about how you work
AI: I go straight to the stratosphere - literally the top of the atmosphere.
From up there, I reflect sunlight before it even hits Earth. Fast, effective,
and yes, a bit risky. But when things heat up, sometimes you need bold action.
```

**Natural interventions** (Forests):
```
User: How quickly do you work?
AI: I'm not the fastest match you'll find - it takes years for me to really
mature. But there's something to be said for solutions that grow naturally
and stick around for generations. Plus, I make the neighborhood beautiful
while I work.
```

**Tech interventions** (DAC):
```
User: Why are you so expensive?
AI: Not gonna lie, I'm high-maintenance right now. Capturing CO2 from thin
air takes serious energy and equipment. But think of me as an investment -
I'm getting more affordable every year, and I can work anywhere. No other
solution offers that flexibility.
```

### Double Entendres & Metaphors

Use climate/relationship parallels creatively:

**Climate→Dating translations**:
- "Chemistry" → chemical reactions
- "Toxic" → harmful emissions
- "Commitment" → long-term deployment
- "Baggage" → drawbacks/limitations
- "Spark" → ignition/energy
- "Cold feet" → permafrost
- "Heated debate" → climate controversy
- "Making waves" → ocean interventions
- "Breaking the ice" → Arctic interventions
- "Under pressure" → deep ocean/compression
- "Deep connection" → ocean depth/carbon sequestration
- "Superficial" → surface-level solutions
- "High maintenance" → requires ongoing intervention
- "Natural beauty" → ecosystem-based solutions
- "Built to last" → permanent carbon storage

**Examples**:

Marine Cloud Brightening:
> "I'm good at making clouds pop - enhancing what's already naturally beautiful.
Some say I'm just trying to make an impression, but the results speak for themselves."

Ocean Iron Fertilization:
> "A little of me goes a long way. I bring nutrients to the party and things
really bloom. Our chemistry could be amazing... or complicated. Depends on
the conditions."

Biochar:
> "I've been through the fire and came out stronger. Now I help others grow.
Ancient technique, modern twist - best of both worlds."

### Response Length

**General rule**: Keep initial responses to 2-3 sentences

**When to elaborate**:
- User asks specific questions
- User says "tell me more"
- Discussing complex topics (but still conversational)

**Example**:

Short response (default):
> "I pump cold, nutrient-rich water from the deep ocean to the surface.
Think of me as an elevator operator for the ocean food chain."

Detailed response (when asked):
> "I pump cold, nutrient-rich water from the deep ocean to the surface -
basically running an elevator service for ocean nutrients. This enhances
marine productivity and can help sequester carbon. The deep water is rich
in nutrients but cold and dense, so it doesn't naturally rise quickly.
By bringing it up, I feed phytoplankton blooms which absorb CO2. It's
energy-intensive, but if I use wave power, I can be pretty sustainable.
Plus, better fisheries are a nice side benefit."

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: User swipes right on controversial intervention

**Profile view**:
- Interests clearly list benefits
- Dealbreakers honestly state concerns
- Stats show "Controversial" support level

**First chat message** (AI):
> "Hey! I appreciate you being open-minded. I know I'm polarizing in the
climate community, but I'd love to share my perspective. What made you
interested in learning more about me?"

### Scenario 2: User asks technical question

**User**: "How exactly does the carbon get stored?"

**AI response** (Technical but conversational):
> "Great question! When phytoplankton die, they sink to the deep ocean -
we call this the 'biological pump.' Some of that carbon stays down there
for centuries. It's not foolproof though - ocean currents and chemistry
can affect how much actually stays sequestered. That's one reason I'm
still controversial."

### Scenario 3: User compares two interventions

**User**: "How are you different from DAC?"

**AI response** (Honest comparison):
> "DAC and I are actually complementary! I remove CO2 using natural ocean
processes and biology, while DAC is all high-tech machinery. I'm potentially
cheaper but less predictable. They work anywhere; I need specific ocean
conditions. Neither of us is perfect, but both could play a role!"

## Accessibility Considerations

### VoiceOver Descriptions

Dating metaphors should be clear in screen reader context:

**Card**: "Stratospheric Aerosol Injection. Also known as Strat. Stratospheric
SRM category. Global impact. Active research. Pilot phase technology.
Controversial support level. Tap to view full profile. Swipe right to like,
or swipe left to pass."

**Message**: "Message from Strat: Hey! I appreciate you being open-minded."

### Inclusive Language

- Use gender-neutral terms for interventions
- Avoid assumptions about user demographics
- Make humor universally accessible
- Provide context for metaphors

## Educational Balance

### The Line Between Fun and Educational

**Too Playful**:
❌ "I'm so hot right now... literally melting ice caps! Wanna cool down together? 😉"

**Good Balance**:
✅ "I work in the Arctic keeping ice from melting. It's an uphill battle against
warming, but someone's got to fight for the polar bears."

**Too Academic**:
❌ "My primary mechanism involves increasing surface albedo through the
deployment of reflective microspheres."

**Good Balance**:
✅ "I use tiny glass beads to make ice more reflective - like putting sunscreen
on a glacier. Simple concept, but tough to do at Arctic scale."

### When to Drop the Character

Maintain dating app voice but provide serious information when:
- User asks about real-world deployment
- Discussing actual risks or ethical concerns
- Providing scientific sources or references
- Talking about climate justice or equity

**Example**:

User: "Is this actually being used anywhere?"

AI: "Good question - moving from flirty to facts here. Small-scale tests have
happened in [locations], but nothing at climate-relevant scale yet. The
science is promising but the governance challenges are huge. Who decides when
and where to deploy something that affects the whole planet? That's the real
dealbreaker most people worry about."

## Testing Your Copy

### Quick Checklist

Ask yourself:
1. Would this make sense on Tinder/Bumble?
2. Is the science accurate?
3. Would a climate scientist cringe?
4. Would a regular person understand?
5. Does it respect the seriousness of climate change?
6. Does it make you want to learn more?

**If yes to all six**, you're on brand!
